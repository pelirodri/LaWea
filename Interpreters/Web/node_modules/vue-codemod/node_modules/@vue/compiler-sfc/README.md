> Lower level utilities for compiling Vue single file components

This package contains lower level utilities that you can use if you are writing a plugin / transform for a bundler or module system that compiles Vue single file components into JavaScript. It is used in [vue-loader](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader).

The API surface is intentionally minimal - the goal is to reuse as much as possible while being as flexible as possible.

## Browser Build Usage

This package relies on `postcss`, `postcss-selector-parser` and `postcss-modules`
